<Study Guide Project>

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- The motivation for this project was that I needed a study tool, that ultimately became a working web page?
- I built this project because it would help more than just me on the beginning concepts of web development.
- I hope the problem that this solves is that it helps new web devs to piece together their knowledge and is a resource for quickly looking something they may be using to develop a project of their own.
- I learned through developing this site that this wasn't quite a scary thing to do and that anyone wanting to put in enough time and effort could do it.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

The website is pretty self exclamatory after opening up the developer tools either on Google Chrome or Firefox. Looking through the console there should help give you a direction of study which from there should help you identify the helpful notes left on the webpage/html file that populated when you first entered the site.
